                            I'm a passionate full-stack developer who loves creating digital experiences
                            that make a difference. With a strong foundation in both design and development,
                            I bridge the gap between beautiful interfaces and robust functionality.

                            Currently, I focus on building modern web applications using React, Node.js,
                            and cutting-edge technologies. I'm always learning, always improving, and
                            always excited about the next challenge.

                            When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new design trends,
                            contributing to open-source projects, or working on side projects that
                            solve interesting problems.
